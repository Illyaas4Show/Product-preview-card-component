## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learnt about the `flex-basis: ;` property in flex-box to help with the proportions of each flexed item. I used it to make the image the same width as the information section.

### Continued development

I still want to continue working on flex-box as I still feel like there is still a bit more I need to know about it before I can tick it off.
